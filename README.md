## How does it work?
We will be using **SceneViewer** by triggering a explicit intent to it. 
Scene Viewer is an immersive viewer that enables 3D and AR experiences from our Android app. It lets users of our application easily preview, place, view, and interact with web-hosted 3D models in their environment. It uses **ARCore**, which is Google’s platform for building augmented reality experiences. Using different APIs, ARCore enables our application to sense its environment, understand the world and interact with information.
## Product Ideas
1. **Custom AR Solutions**: Tailored solutions for seamless integration, aligning with brand identity and enhancing the customer experience.
2. **Increased Engagement**: Boost engagement with AR for interactivity and memorable shopping, fostering a stronger brand connection.
3. **Effectiveness Metrics**: Employ analytics tools to measure AR impact on engagement, conversion rates, and customer satisfaction.
4. **Cost-Efficient AR**: Provide budget-friendly alternatives to physical stores through AR, expanding brand reach.
5. **Scalable Future**: Design for scalability, allowing easy expansion of AR use as preferences and tech evolve.
6. **Iterative Development**: Enable continuous improvement through iterative development for optimal AR performance.

ARCore uses three key capabilities to integrate virtual content with the real world as seen through your phone's camera:
1. **Motion tracking** allows the phone to understand and track its position relative to the world.
2. **Environmental understanding** allows the phone to detect the size and location of all type of surfaces: horizontal, vertical and angled surfaces like the ground, a coffee table or walls.
3. **Light estimation** allows the phone to estimate the environment's current lighting conditions.

## How quick can this technology be implemented ?
Our solution can be instantly be brought to production with the existing shopping applications for different products.

## What is the impact of this solution ?
The impact of adding this feature will be huge, as we’ve now reduced the gap between our customers and the actual product. More and more people would be eager to try the product and ultimately increase the sales by a very large factor.
The impact of this solution is significant, as it addresses key challenges in the retail industry and offers several benefits:
 1. **Inclusivity**: By providing personalized experiences for customers of all body types, the solution fosters inclusivity in online shopping, ensuring that everyone feels represented and valued.
 2. **Precision in Size Selection**: The AR technology helps overcome size variance issues, reducing the likelihood of returns and improving customer satisfaction.
 3. **Accessibility**: Implementing AR features for persons with disabilities enhances accessibility, making it easier for everyone to engage in virtual try-ons and shop online.
 4. **Customer-Centric Innovation**: By driving customer empowerment through innovative AR features, the solution creates a more engaging and personalized shopping experience, strengthening the brand-consumer 
    relationship.

 
## Is the solution scalable ?
 The solution is designed to be scalable. By leveraging AR technology, which is inherently digital and flexible, the solution can easily adapt to changing customer preferences and technological advancements. The design considerations for scalability, such as cost-efficient AR solutions and iterative development, ensure that the solution can grow and evolve over time. This scalability allows for the implementation of new features and the expansion into new markets, making it a sustainable and future-proof solution for the retail industry.
